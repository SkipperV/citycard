Elasticsearch container may take some time to fully initialize after startup, even though it appears to be in the 
"running" state. During this period, Elasticsearch may be under heavy load as it performs operations like index creation
and shard allocation.

Please follow these steps before proceeding with further commands:

1. Wait for the container to finish initializing.
2. Monitor the CPU usage of the Elasticsearch container using command ```dockerÂ stats``` or similar tools.
3. Ensure the CPU usage is low and stable before running commands that interact with Elasticsearch and database.
* Create Elasticsearch cities index
```
docker exec citycard-app search:create-cities-index
```
* Run migrations and seed database
```
docker exec citycard-app php artisan migrate --seed
```
* Run npm build to build frontend components
```
npm run build
```
